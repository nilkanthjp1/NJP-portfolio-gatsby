I like building products. I’m a product designer at Quantcast. In the past, I’ve been a Graphics Editor at The New York Times, and an Editorial Production Associate at The New Yorker. I’m a veteran of the product development cycle, and have a pretty rigorous process for designing and interating on the stuff I help build. I like writing CSS, and I like animating in it too. I also love React, Angular, d3, and any front-end framework that makes it easier for me to build beautiful things for the Web. In 2011, I graduated from Columbia University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. Two years later, I went back for an M.S. in Computer Science, and then another M.S. in Journalism. If any of this sounds interesting to you, and you’d like to chat, feel free to get in touch.

This site was built using React, Gatsby, and deployed with the wonderful Netlify. All of the animations were done in CSS. (Take, that, jQuery!) You can find the source code and original .sketch file here.
